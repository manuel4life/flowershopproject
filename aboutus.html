            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In 1967, Mrs Margaret Nunoo – Mensah established PREMIER FLORIST,Ghana’s first <br> Florist and Horticulture Shop. Premier Florist is not only the leading house <br> of flowers in Ghana, but also the largest and most exotic of its type.<br>                At Premier Florist, we stock a large variety of flowers and plants for home<br> decorations, wedding ceremonies, parties and wreath-laying for funerals.</p>

            <p>
                PREMIER FLORIST is situated at the Danquah Circle, Accra , Ghana and is under
                <br> the careful and conscious management of Mrs. Margaret Nunoo-Mensah (Auntie Maggie).<br> Auntie Maggie is a trained florist from the world-renowned London Schoolof <br>Floristry and Horticulture; and in Ikebana, where she qualified
                also in the Japanese Art <br>and Science in Flower Management in the 1960s. She is currently a member of the<br> Kew Guilds and Ikebana International in Tokyo, Japan.
